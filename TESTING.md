# Testing Kaspa All-in-One v0.9.0

## Welcome Testers! 🎉

Thank you for helping test Kaspa All-in-One! Your participation is invaluable in making this project better for everyone in the Kaspa community.

### What is Kaspa All-in-One?

Kaspa All-in-One is a comprehensive deployment system that makes it easy to run Kaspa infrastructure on your own hardware. Whether you want to run a Kaspa node, host user applications, or operate indexer services, this system provides a guided installation wizard that handles all the complexity for you.

### What is This Test Release?

This is **version 0.9.0-test**, a pre-production release designed specifically for testing. Your feedback will help us:

- **Identify bugs** before the official v1.0 release
- **Improve documentation** to make it clearer for all users
- **Validate installation** across different platforms and configurations
- **Enhance user experience** based on real-world usage
- **Ensure reliability** for production deployments

### What You'll Be Testing

During this test, you'll:

1. **Install the system** using our web-based wizard
2. **Deploy Kaspa services** based on different profiles (node, applications, indexers)
3. **Verify functionality** of installed services
4. **Test error handling** and recovery mechanisms
5. **Provide feedback** on your experience

### Your Role as a Tester

As a tester, you are:

- **An explorer**: Try different configurations and see what works
- **A detective**: Help us find bugs and issues we might have missed
- **A teacher**: Tell us what's confusing or could be clearer
- **A partner**: Your feedback directly shapes the final product

You don't need to be a Kaspa expert or a Linux guru. If you can follow instructions and report what you see, you're qualified to help!

### What We Need From You

**Feedback**: Please report:
- ✅ What worked well
- ❌ What didn't work
- 🤔 What was confusing
- 💡 Ideas for improvement

**Honesty**: We want to hear about problems! Finding issues now helps everyone later.

### Testing Period

- **Start Date**: [To be announced]
- **End Date**: [To be announced]
- **Duration**: Approximately 2 weeks

### What Happens Next?

After the testing period:

1. We'll review all feedback and bug reports
2. Fix critical issues and improve documentation
3. Release additional test versions if needed (v0.9.1-test, etc.)
4. Prepare for the official v1.0 production release

Your testing directly determines when we're ready for v1.0!
