# TimescaleDB Integration PR Proposals

This directory contains detailed PR proposals for integrating TimescaleDB optimizations into the Kaspa indexer ecosystem to handle Kaspa's 10 blocks/second rate more efficiently.

## üìä Overview

Kaspa's high-frequency blockchain (10 blocks/second = 864,000 blocks/day) creates unique challenges for indexing systems. TimescaleDB, a time-series database built on PostgreSQL, provides significant performance and storage benefits for this type of time-ordered data.

## üéØ Proposed Integrations

### 1. [K Social Indexer TimescaleDB Integration](./k-social-indexer-timescaledb-pr.md)

**Target Repository**: [thesheepcat/K-indexer](https://github.com/thesheepcat/K-indexer)

**Key Benefits**:
- 10-100x faster time-range queries for social media data
- 50-90% storage reduction with automatic compression
- Real-time analytics with continuous aggregates
- Optimized for K protocol transaction processing

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Convert social media tables (k_posts, k_votes, k_user_profiles) to hypertables
- 1-6 hour chunk intervals optimized for social activity patterns
- Continuous aggregates for user activity and post statistics
- Batch processing optimizations for high-frequency social data

### 2. [Simply Kaspa Indexer TimescaleDB Integration](./simply-kaspa-indexer-timescaledb-pr.md)

**Target Repository**: [supertypo/simply-kaspa-indexer](https://github.com/supertypo/simply-kaspa-indexer)

**Key Benefits**:
- Enhanced performance for already high-throughput Rust implementation
- Time-based partitioning for 864,000 blocks/day
- Automatic compression for historical blockchain data
- Real-time network analytics and monitoring

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Convert blocks and transactions tables to hypertables
- 15-30 minute chunk intervals optimized for 10bps rate
- Advanced compression policies for blockchain data
- Continuous aggregates for network statistics and analytics

## üìà Performance Improvements

### Expected Gains Across Both Systems:

| Metric | Current Performance | With TimescaleDB | Improvement Factor |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Time-Range Queries** | 1-10 seconds | 10-100 milliseconds | **10-100x faster** |
| **Storage Usage** | 100% baseline | 10-50% of original | **50-90% reduction** |
| **Analytics Queries** | 30-300 seconds | 1-10 seconds | **10-60x faster** |
| **Concurrent Writes** | Limited by locks | High concurrency | **5-10x throughput** |
| **Data Compression** | None | Automatic | **90%+ space savings** |

### Kaspa-Specific Optimizations:

#### **Chunk Sizing Strategy**:
- **10 blocks/second** = 36,000 blocks/hour
- **Optimal chunk sizes**: 15-30 minutes (9,000-18,000 blocks)
- **Balance**: Query performance vs partition management overhead

#### **Compression Timeline**:
- **Recent data** (1-2 hours): Uncompressed for fast queries
- **Historical data** (>2 hours): Compressed for storage efficiency
- **Archive data** (>30 days): Maximum compression with retention policies

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Enhancements:

```sql
-- Example: Convert blocks table to hypertable
ALTER TABLE blocks ADD COLUMN block_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ;
UPDATE blocks SET block_timestamp = to_timestamp("timestamp" / 1000.0);

SELECT create_hypertable('blocks', 'block_timestamp', 
    chunk_time_interval => INTERVAL '30 minutes',
    migrate_data => true);

-- Add compression for data older than 2 hours
SELECT add_compression_policy('blocks', INTERVAL '2 hours');
```

### Performance Monitoring:

```sql
-- Monitor chunk performance
SELECT 
    chunk_name,
    pg_size_pretty(before_compression_bytes) as original_size,
    pg_size_pretty(after_compression_bytes) as compressed_size,
    compression_ratio
FROM timescaledb_information.chunk_compression_stats;
```

## üöÄ Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: K Social Indexer (2-3 weeks)
1. **Week 1**: Schema migration and hypertable conversion
2. **Week 2**: Code optimization for batch processing
3. **Week 3**: Testing and performance validation

### Phase 2: Simply Kaspa Indexer (3-4 weeks)
1. **Week 1-2**: Core schema migration and Rust code updates
2. **Week 3**: Advanced features (compression, continuous aggregates)
3. **Week 4**: Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (1-2 weeks)
1. **Load testing** with simulated 10bps traffic
2. **Performance benchmarking** and comparison
3. **Documentation** and deployment guides

## üìä Success Metrics

### Performance Targets:
- **Query Response Time**: <100ms for time-range queries
- **Storage Efficiency**: >50% reduction in storage usage
- **Throughput**: Sustained 10bps processing without degradation
- **Compression Ratio**: >5:1 for historical data
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during normal operations

### Monitoring Dashboards:
- Real-time query performance metrics
- Storage usage and compression ratios
- Network statistics and blockchain analytics
- System resource utilization

## ü§ù Collaboration

### For Repository Authors:

These proposals are designed to enhance existing systems while maintaining backward compatibility. Key considerations:

1. **Incremental Migration**: Existing deployments can migrate gradually
2. **Feature Flags**: TimescaleDB features can be enabled/disabled
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing APIs and queries continue to work
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics to validate improvements

### Community Benefits:

- **Improved Performance**: Faster queries and analytics for all users
- **Reduced Costs**: Lower storage and infrastructure requirements
- **Better Scalability**: Handle growing blockchain data efficiently
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Real-time insights into Kaspa network activity
