# Kaspa All-in-One Project Requirements

## Introduction

The Kaspa All-in-One project provides a comprehensive Docker-based solution for running Kaspa blockchain infrastructure, including nodes, indexers, applications, and management tools. The system is designed to be easily deployable on consumer hardware while supporting various operational profiles from development to production.

## Glossary

- **Kaspa_Node**: The core Kaspa blockchain node (rusty-kaspad) that maintains the blockchain state
- **Indexer_Service**: Services that process blockchain data and provide APIs (Kasia, K-Social, Simply-Kaspa)
- **Management_Dashboard**: Web-based interface for monitoring and controlling services
- **Profile_System**: Docker Compose profile-based deployment configurations
- **TimescaleDB**: Time-series database optimized for blockchain data storage
- **All_in_One_System**: The complete integrated solution including all components

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Infrastructure Management

**User Story:** As a node operator, I want to deploy and manage Kaspa blockchain infrastructure easily, so that I can participate in the network without complex manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the installation script, THE All_in_One_System SHALL deploy a functional Kaspa node within 10 minutes
2. WHEN the Kaspa node starts, THE All_in_One_System SHALL automatically connect to the Kaspa network and begin synchronization
3. WHEN services are deployed, THE Management_Dashboard SHALL provide real-time status monitoring for all components
4. WHERE a user selects a deployment profile, THE All_in_One_System SHALL only start services included in that profile
5. IF a service fails, THEN THE All_in_One_System SHALL provide diagnostic information and recovery options

### Requirement 2: Service Integration and Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run blockchain indexers and applications that connect to my local Kaspa node, so that I can build and test applications without relying on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN indexer services start, THE All_in_One_System SHALL automatically connect them to the local Kaspa node
2. WHEN TimescaleDB is deployed, THE All_in_One_System SHALL optimize it for blockchain data storage with hypertables and compression
3. WHILE indexers are running, THE All_in_One_System SHALL maintain data consistency and handle connection failures gracefully
4. WHERE multiple indexers are deployed, THE All_in_One_System SHALL share database resources efficiently
5. IF database storage exceeds configured limits, THEN THE All_in_One_System SHALL implement retention policies automatically

### Requirement 3: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want comprehensive testing frameworks and quality checks, so that I can ensure my changes don't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed, THE All_in_One_System SHALL run automated tests for all affected components
2. WHEN Docker images are built, THE All_in_One_System SHALL scan for security vulnerabilities and compliance issues
3. WHILE tests are running, THE All_in_One_System SHALL provide real-time feedback on test progress and results
4. WHERE integration tests are executed, THE All_in_One_System SHALL validate service interactions and data flows
5. IF quality gates fail, THEN THE All_in_One_System SHALL prevent deployment and provide detailed failure information

### Requirement 4: Documentation and User Experience

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear documentation and guidance, so that I can successfully deploy and operate the system without extensive blockchain knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses documentation, THE All_in_One_System SHALL provide step-by-step installation guides with hardware recommendations
2. WHEN users encounter issues, THE All_in_One_System SHALL provide troubleshooting guides with common solutions
3. WHILE operating the system, THE All_in_One_System SHALL provide contextual help and configuration guidance
4. WHERE users need technical details, THE All_in_One_System SHALL provide comprehensive API documentation and architecture diagrams
5. IF documentation becomes outdated, THEN THE All_in_One_System SHALL automatically update content from code annotations

### Requirement 5: Security and Governance

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want robust security controls and governance processes, so that the project remains secure and trustworthy for the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN releases are created, THE All_in_One_System SHALL cryptographically sign all artifacts and verify integrity
2. WHEN pull requests are submitted, THE All_in_One_System SHALL require security reviews and automated scanning
3. WHILE the system operates, THE All_in_One_System SHALL monitor for security vulnerabilities and provide automated updates
4. WHERE sensitive operations occur, THE All_in_One_System SHALL require multi-factor authentication and audit logging
5. IF security incidents are detected, THEN THE All_in_One_System SHALL implement automated response procedures and notifications

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a power user, I want the system to perform efficiently and scale with my needs, so that I can run production workloads reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts, THE All_in_One_System SHALL optimize resource allocation based on available hardware
2. WHEN load increases, THE All_in_One_System SHALL scale services horizontally within resource constraints
3. WHILE under load, THE All_in_One_System SHALL maintain response times within acceptable thresholds
4. WHERE performance degrades, THE All_in_One_System SHALL provide monitoring alerts and optimization recommendations
5. IF resource limits are reached, THEN THE All_in_One_System SHALL gracefully handle overload conditions without data loss
